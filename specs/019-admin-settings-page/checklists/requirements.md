# Specification Quality Checklist: Admin Settings Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-05-29  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- FR-004 references the WordPress Settings API by name (an API, not a tech stack detail) — acceptable as it describes the required integration surface
- FR-005, FR-006 reference `absint` — acceptable as these are WordPress data-contract terms that define the sanitization behaviour, not an implementation choice
- All clarifications were resolved via explicit user description; no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed
