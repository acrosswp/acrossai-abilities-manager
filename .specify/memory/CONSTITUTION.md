# AcrossAI Abilities Manager Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modular Architecture
Each feature MUST be implemented as a self-contained module with a clear, singular purpose.
Modules MUST be independently testable, extensible, and replaceable without affecting sibling modules.
Shared logic MUST be extracted to `includes/Utilities/` or abstract base classes in `includes/Base/`.
No code duplication between modules is permitted under any circumstance.

**Rationale**: Enables parallel development, isolated testing, and safe iteration on any single feature
without risking regressions in others. The five feature areas (Sitewide Management, Per-User Access
Control, MCP Server Management, Custom Ability Registration, WebMCP Integration) MUST each map to
exactly one module.

### II. WordPress Standards Compliance
All PHP code MUST conform to WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS strict profile).
Static analysis MUST pass PHPStan at level 8 with zero errors.
JavaScript MUST pass ESLint with zero errors or warnings.
All output MUST be escaped using the most specific available WordPress escaping function.
All input MUST be sanitized at system entry points.
No deprecated WordPress functions are permitted.
The plugin MUST be compatible with WordPress 6.9+ and PHP 7.4+.
The plugin MUST be multisite-compatible unless a feature is explicitly scoped to single-site with
documented justification.

**Rationale**: Compliance ensures plugin quality, security, and long-term maintainability within the
WordPress ecosystem. Non-compliant code will not be merged.

### III. User-Centric Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All admin interfaces MUST prioritize site administrator experience above implementation convenience.
All form handling and data input MUST use `@wordpress/dataforms` (WordPress DataForms).
All data display and listing MUST use `@wordpress/dataviews` (WordPress DataViews).
DataForms MUST handle: field-level validation, inline error display, and submission state feedback.
DataViews MUST provide: searchable lists, column sorting, pagination, and contextual filtering.
No custom form or table rendering that duplicates DataForms/DataViews functionality is permitted.

**Rationale**: Consistency with WordPress core UI patterns reduces the learning curve for
administrators and ensures a coherent, familiar admin experience across all five feature areas.

### IV. Security First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- All input MUST be sanitized at system boundaries using the most specific WordPress sanitization
  function (e.g., `sanitize_text_field()`, `absint()`, `wp_kses_post()`)
- All output MUST be escaped at the point of rendering (e.g., `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`)
- All forms and AJAX endpoints MUST verify a nonce before processing any data
- All admin actions MUST enforce a capability check (`manage_options` minimum, or more granular)
- All database queries MUST use `$wpdb->prepare()` — raw interpolated queries are forbidden
- File upload operations MUST validate MIME type, extension, and file size before processing
- No deprecated WordPress security functions are permitted

**Rationale**: Security failures have irreversible real-world consequences. These rules are absolute
and cannot be waived for velocity, deadlines, or any other reason.

### V. Extensibility Without Core Modification
New features and third-party integrations (WPBoilerplate Access Control, MCP servers, WebMCP)
MUST be implemented via WordPress action/filter hooks, extension points, or new self-contained
modules — never by modifying existing core plugin files.
All integrations MUST be optional: the plugin MUST function correctly and degrade gracefully
when an integrated plugin or service is absent.
Auto-discovery of external services (e.g., MCP servers) MUST be implemented as a background
process and MUST NOT block admin page rendering.

**Rationale**: Prevents merge conflicts, preserves update safety, and enables ecosystem growth
without introducing tight coupling between the core plugin and optional dependencies.

### VI. Reusability & DRY Principle
All common logic MUST be extracted to shared utilities (`includes/Utilities/`) or abstract base
classes (`includes/Base/`) before it is used in a second location.
Reusable components MUST be built and maintained for: form builders, view generators, input
validation, output sanitization, API response formatters, and permission checks.
If equivalent functionality already exists anywhere in the codebase, it MUST be reused — never
duplicated. Before implementing any utility, the existing codebase MUST be checked.
Use `@wordpress/*` packages first (Tier 1), then npm packages (Tier 2). Never introduce a
dependency that duplicates React, ReactDOM, or other packages already bundled by WordPress.
Run `npm run validate-packages` before every commit to enforce this hierarchy.

**Rationale**: Duplication creates maintenance burden, divergence bugs, and contradictory behaviour.
A single source of truth for every abstraction keeps the codebase consistent and auditable.

### VII. Definition of Done
A feature is ONLY considered complete when ALL of the following gates pass:

- [ ] PHPCS validation: zero errors and zero warnings
- [ ] PHPStan level 8: zero errors
- [ ] ESLint: zero errors
- [ ] Security review complete: sanitization, escaping, nonces, and capabilities verified at every boundary
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing for all new logic
- [ ] All data input uses DataForms (`@wordpress/dataforms`)
- [ ] All data display uses DataViews (`@wordpress/dataviews`)
- [ ] No code duplication or DRY violations exist in the changeset
- [ ] All functions, hooks, and classes are prefixed with `acrossai_`
- [ ] All standards in `AGENTS.md` are met
- [ ] `npm run validate-packages` passes

**Rationale**: Partial completion creates technical debt that compounds across features. This gate
enforces consistent, shippable quality at every increment.

## Code Quality & Workflow

- All PHP functions, hooks, filters, and class names MUST be prefixed with `acrossai_`
- All forms and AJAX handlers MUST verify nonces using `check_ajax_referer()` or `wp_verify_nonce()`
- Capability checks MUST be enforced on all admin page renders and all data-mutation endpoints
- Input MUST be sanitized immediately upon receipt; output MUST be escaped at the point of render
- No deprecated WordPress functions are permitted — use the current replacement
- Use `wp_remote_get()` / `wp_remote_post()` for all outbound HTTP requests; never call `curl` directly
- Prefer Action Scheduler for all async, scheduled, or background operations
- Use `@wordpress/*` packages (Tier 1), then npm packages (Tier 2); avoid Tier 3 external frameworks
  that duplicate dependencies already bundled by WordPress
- Run `npm run validate-packages` before every commit
- Never modify files inside `.agents/tools/` — these are external submodule dependencies

## Architecture & UI Standards

**Directory Layout**:
```
admin/
└── Partials/       # All admin-facing classes: menu, page renderers, asset enqueues
includes/
├── Base/           # Abstract base classes extended by all feature modules
├── Utilities/      # Shared utility functions, helpers, formatters
└── Modules/        # One subdirectory per feature module (self-contained)
    ├── Sitewide/
    ├── PerUser/
    ├── McpServer/
    ├── CustomAbility/
    └── Webmcp/
src/
├── js/             # JavaScript/React source files
└── scss/           # Stylesheet source files (compiled by @wordpress/scripts)
tests/
├── phpunit/        # PHP unit and integration tests
└── jest/           # JavaScript unit tests
```

**Admin Partials Rule**: Any class that calls `add_menu_page()`, enqueues admin assets via
`wp_enqueue_style()` / `wp_enqueue_script()`, or renders admin HTML MUST live in `admin/Partials/`
with namespace `AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Admin\Partials`. Classes in `includes/` are
context-neutral — they MUST NOT contain admin-specific logic.

**Boot Flow Rule**: Feature modules MUST expose a `register_hooks( Loader $loader )` method.
`includes/Main.php::define_admin_hooks()` or `define_public_hooks()` MUST instantiate each module
and call `$module->register_hooks( $this->loader )`. Modules MUST NOT call `Loader::instance()`
themselves. No hook-registering code MAY run inside `load_dependencies()`.

**Module Contract**: Every feature module MUST:
1. Extend the appropriate abstract base class from `includes/Base/`
2. Expose a `register_hooks( Loader $loader )` method — never self-register via `Loader::instance()`
3. Depend only on shared utilities from `includes/Utilities/` — never on sibling modules directly
4. Expose integration points exclusively via WordPress actions and filters

**UI Contract**:
- `@wordpress/dataforms` handles all admin form UIs: field validation, error display, submission state
- `@wordpress/dataviews` handles all admin list/table UIs: search, sort, pagination, filter
- No custom implementations of form or table patterns that duplicate DataForms/DataViews are permitted

**Database**:
- Direct SQL is permitted only with `$wpdb->prepare()`
- Prefer WordPress options/meta APIs for simple key-value or per-object storage
- Custom database tables are only permitted when the data model genuinely cannot fit existing APIs,
  with documented justification in the feature plan

**Integration Resilience**:
- All calls to optional integrations (WPBoilerplate Access Control, MCP servers) MUST be wrapped in
  availability checks and MUST NOT throw fatal errors or produce broken UIs when absent

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices for the AcrossAI Abilities Manager plugin.
In any conflict between this constitution and another document, this constitution takes precedence.
`AGENTS.md` remains the source of truth for tooling standards; this constitution governs architecture
and quality principles.

**Amendment Procedure**:
1. Propose the amendment in writing with clear rationale
2. Increment version following semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: backward-incompatible removal or redefinition of a principle
   - MINOR: new principle added or existing principle materially expanded
   - PATCH: clarifications, wording fixes, or non-semantic refinements
3. Update this file and propagate changes to all affected templates
4. Record a sync impact report (in the HTML comment block at the top of this file)
5. Commit with message: `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (<summary>)`

**Compliance**: All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with every principle in this
constitution. Any implementation that appears to violate a principle MUST either be refactored or
include documented justification in the feature plan explaining why a compliant approach was not
feasible.

**Version**: 1.2.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-05-11 | **Last Amended**: 2026-05-11
