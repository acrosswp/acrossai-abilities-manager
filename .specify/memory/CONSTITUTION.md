SYNC IMPACT REPORT
Version change: 1.4.0 → 1.4.1
Modified principles: Integration Resilience — added canonical pattern for MCP server listing via wpboilerplate/wpb-mcp-servers-list Composer package
Added sections: None
Removed sections: None
Templates reviewed:
  - .specify/templates/plan-template.md ✅ reviewed — no outdated references
  - .specify/templates/spec-template.md ✅ reviewed — no outdated references
  - .specify/templates/tasks-template.md ✅ reviewed — no outdated references
  - .specify/templates/checklist-template.md ✅ reviewed — no outdated references
Deferred TODOs: None
Rationale: Direct McpAdapter consumption required undocumented timing knowledge and manual getter mapping
(McpServer objects have private properties). wpboilerplate/wpb-mcp-servers-list encapsulates both concerns;
its collect() method is wired in Main.php at rest_api_init priority 20 via the Loader. Integration Resilience
updated to name this as the canonical approach. Patch bump — clarification of existing principle, no new
principle added.

Previous sync impact (v1.3.0 → v1.4.0): Boot Flow Rule — variable-first instantiation requirement added;
REST Controller Pattern subsection added under Architecture & UI Standards.
Previous sync impact (v1.2.0 → v1.3.0): §I Base/ removed, Boot Flow Rule updated to singleton + direct wiring, Module Contract updated to replace abstract base class + register_hooks() with singleton pattern.

Version change: 1.4.1 → 1.4.2
Modified sections: Directory Layout (Logger/ added), §I (module count corrected)
Rationale: Logger module existed but was omitted from the module list;
namespace examples already referenced it correctly.

# AcrossAI Abilities Manager Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modular Architecture
Each feature MUST be implemented as a self-contained module with a clear, singular purpose.
Modules MUST be independently testable, extensible, and replaceable without affecting sibling modules.
Shared logic MUST be extracted to `includes/Utilities/`.
No code duplication between modules is permitted under any circumstance.

**Rationale**: Enables parallel development, isolated testing, and safe iteration on any single feature
without risking regressions in others. The five active feature areas (Per-User Access
Control, MCP Server Management, Custom Ability Registration, WebMCP Integration, Ability Execution Logging) MUST each map to
exactly one module. Ability override management is part of the `Abilities` module (Feature 012).

### II. WordPress Standards Compliance
All PHP code MUST conform to WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS strict profile).
Static analysis MUST pass PHPStan at level 8 with zero errors.
JavaScript MUST pass ESLint with zero errors or warnings.
All output MUST be escaped using the most specific available WordPress escaping function.
All input MUST be sanitized at system entry points.
No deprecated WordPress functions are permitted.
The plugin MUST be compatible with WordPress 6.9+ and PHP 7.4+.
The plugin MUST be multisite-compatible unless a feature is explicitly scoped to single-site with
documented justification.

**Rationale**: Compliance ensures plugin quality, security, and long-term maintainability within the
WordPress ecosystem. Non-compliant code will not be merged.

### III. User-Centric Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All admin interfaces MUST prioritize site administrator experience above implementation convenience.
All form handling and data input MUST use `DataForm` (exported from `@wordpress/dataviews`) — there is no separate `@wordpress/dataforms` package.
All data display and listing MUST use `@wordpress/dataviews` (WordPress DataViews).
DataForm MUST handle: field-level validation, inline error display, and submission state feedback.
DataViews MUST provide: searchable lists, column sorting, pagination, and contextual filtering.
No custom form or table rendering that duplicates DataForm/DataViews functionality is permitted.

**Rationale**: Consistency with WordPress core UI patterns reduces the learning curve for
administrators and ensures a coherent, familiar admin experience across all active feature areas.

### IV. Security First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- All input MUST be sanitized at system boundaries using the most specific WordPress sanitization
  function (e.g., `sanitize_text_field()`, `absint()`, `wp_kses_post()`)
- All output MUST be escaped at the point of rendering (e.g., `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`)
- All forms and AJAX endpoints MUST verify a nonce before processing any data
- All admin actions MUST enforce a capability check (`manage_options` minimum, or more granular)
- All database queries MUST use `$wpdb->prepare()` — raw interpolated queries are forbidden
- File upload operations MUST validate MIME type, extension, and file size before processing
- No deprecated WordPress security functions are permitted

**Rationale**: Security failures have irreversible real-world consequences. These rules are absolute
and cannot be waived for velocity, deadlines, or any other reason.

### V. Extensibility Without Core Modification
New features and third-party integrations (WPBoilerplate Access Control, MCP servers, WebMCP)
MUST be implemented via WordPress action/filter hooks, extension points, or new self-contained
modules — never by modifying existing core plugin files.
All integrations MUST be optional: the plugin MUST function correctly and degrade gracefully
when an integrated plugin or service is absent.
Auto-discovery of external services (e.g., MCP servers) MUST be implemented as a background
process and MUST NOT block admin page rendering.

**Rationale**: Prevents merge conflicts, preserves update safety, and enables ecosystem growth
without introducing tight coupling between the core plugin and optional dependencies.

### VI. Reusability & DRY Principle
All common logic MUST be extracted to shared utilities (`includes/Utilities/`) before it is used in a second location.
Reusable components MUST be built and maintained for: form builders, view generators, input
validation, output sanitization, API response formatters, and permission checks.
If equivalent functionality already exists anywhere in the codebase, it MUST be reused — never
duplicated. Before implementing any utility, the existing codebase MUST be checked.
Use `@wordpress/*` packages first (Tier 1), then npm packages (Tier 2). Never introduce a
dependency that duplicates React, ReactDOM, or other packages already bundled by WordPress.
Run `npm run validate-packages` before every commit to enforce this hierarchy.

**Rationale**: Duplication creates maintenance burden, divergence bugs, and contradictory behaviour.
A single source of truth for every abstraction keeps the codebase consistent and auditable.

### VII. Definition of Done
A feature is ONLY considered complete when ALL of the following gates pass:

- [ ] PHPCS validation: zero errors and zero warnings
- [ ] PHPStan level 8: zero errors
- [ ] ESLint: zero errors
- [ ] Security review complete: sanitization, escaping, nonces, and capabilities verified at every boundary
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing for all new logic
- [ ] All data input uses `DataForm` from `@wordpress/dataviews` — no separate `@wordpress/dataforms` package exists
- [ ] All data display uses DataViews (`@wordpress/dataviews`)
- [ ] No code duplication or DRY violations exist in the changeset
- [ ] All functions, hooks, and classes are prefixed with `acrossai_`
- [ ] All standards in `AGENTS.md` are met
- [ ] `npm run validate-packages` passes

**Rationale**: Partial completion creates technical debt that compounds across features. This gate
enforces consistent, shippable quality at every increment.

## Code Quality & Workflow

- All PHP functions, hooks, filters, and class names MUST be prefixed with `acrossai_`
- All forms and AJAX handlers MUST verify nonces using `check_ajax_referer()` or `wp_verify_nonce()`
- Capability checks MUST be enforced on all admin page renders and all data-mutation endpoints
- Input MUST be sanitized immediately upon receipt; output MUST be escaped at the point of render
- No deprecated WordPress functions are permitted — use the current replacement
- Use `wp_remote_get()` / `wp_remote_post()` for all outbound HTTP requests; never call `curl` directly
- Prefer Action Scheduler for all async, scheduled, or background operations
- Use `@wordpress/*` packages (Tier 1), then npm packages (Tier 2); avoid Tier 3 external frameworks
  that duplicate dependencies already bundled by WordPress
- Run `npm run validate-packages` before every commit
- Never modify files inside `.agents/tools/` — these are external submodule dependencies

## Architecture & UI Standards

**Directory Layout**:
```
admin/
└── Partials/       # All admin-facing classes: menu, page renderers, asset enqueues
includes/
├── Utilities/      # Shared utility functions, helpers, formatters
└── Modules/        # One subdirectory per feature module (self-contained)
    ├── PerUser/
    ├── McpServer/
    ├── Abilities/
    ├── Logger/
    └── Webmcp/
src/
├── js/             # JavaScript/React source files
└── scss/           # Stylesheet source files (compiled by @wordpress/scripts)
tests/
├── phpunit/        # PHP unit and integration tests
└── jest/           # JavaScript unit tests
```

**PHP Namespace Rule**: Every PHP class MUST use a namespace that mirrors its directory path under the plugin root, using `AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager` as the root and `\` as the separator. Examples:
- `includes/Main.php` → `AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes`
- `includes/Modules/Logger/AcrossAI_Ability_Logger.php` → `AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes\Modules\Logger`
- `includes/Modules/Logger/Database/AcrossAI_Ability_Logs_Query.php` → `AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes\Modules\Logger\Database`
- `includes/Modules/Logger/Rest/AcrossAI_Logger_Controller.php` → `AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes\Modules\Logger\Rest`
- `includes/Utilities/AcrossAI_Logger_Formatter.php` → `AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes\Utilities`
- `admin/Partials/Menu.php` → `AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Admin\Partials`
Never invent short namespaces like `AcrossAI\Abilities\Logger` — always derive from the full path.

**Admin Partials Rule**: Any class that calls `add_menu_page()`, enqueues admin assets via
`wp_enqueue_style()` / `wp_enqueue_script()`, or renders admin HTML MUST live in `admin/Partials/`
with namespace `AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Admin\Partials`. Classes in `includes/` are
context-neutral — they MUST NOT contain admin-specific logic.

**Boot Flow Rule**: `includes/Main.php` is the single source of all hook registration.
`define_admin_hooks()` and `define_public_hooks()` are the ONLY methods that call
`$this->loader->add_action()` / `$this->loader->add_filter()` — all hooks trace directly to
one of these two methods with no intermediate delegation.
All feature classes use the plugin-wide **singleton `instance()` pattern**:
`protected static $_instance = null;` + `public static function instance(): self`.
`includes/Main.php` resolves each singleton to a **named variable** before passing it to the
Loader — never inline. This is the canonical form:
```php
$rest_controller = FeatureClass::instance();
$this->loader->add_action( 'rest_api_init', $rest_controller, 'register_routes' );
```
Passing `FeatureClass::instance()` directly as the second argument to `add_action` is
**prohibited** — it couples instantiation to hook registration and makes the call harder to read.
Feature classes MUST NOT call `Loader::instance()` themselves.
No `register_hooks()` delegation. No abstract module base class. No `includes/Base/` directory.
No hook-registering code MAY run inside `load_dependencies()`.

**REST Controller Pattern**: A feature module's REST controller MUST be split into per-domain
sub-controllers whenever it would otherwise exceed roughly 400 lines or own more than one user
story's handlers. The split places sub-controllers in a `Rest/` subdirectory inside the module
directory (e.g. `includes/Modules/Abilities/Rest/`). The module's top-level controller becomes
a thin **orchestrator** responsible for exactly three things: (a) the `REST_NAMESPACE` constant,
(b) a `register_routes()` method that calls each sub-controller's `register_routes()`, and (c)
the shared `check_permission()` callback. Sub-controllers MUST use the singleton pattern, MUST
reference the orchestrator's `check_permission` as:
`array( MyOrchestrator::instance(), 'check_permission' )`, and MUST NOT register any WordPress
hooks themselves — only the orchestrator is wired in `Main.php` via the Loader. This is the
canonical decomposition for the planned sibling modules (`PerUser`, `McpServer`,
`CustomAbility`, `Webmcp`). See `specs/002-rest-controller-modularization/` for reference.

**Module Contract**: Every feature class MUST:
1. Implement the singleton `instance()` pattern (`protected static $_instance = null;` + `public static function instance(): self`)
2. Use a `private` constructor; dependencies are obtained via other classes' `::instance()` calls — never via constructor injection from outside
3. Depend only on shared utilities from `includes/Utilities/` — never on sibling modules directly
4. Expose integration points exclusively via WordPress actions and filters

**UI Contract**:
- `DataForm` from `@wordpress/dataviews` handles all admin form UIs: field validation, error display, submission state
- `@wordpress/dataviews` handles all admin list/table UIs: search, sort, pagination, filter
- No custom implementations of form or table patterns that duplicate DataForm/DataViews are permitted

**Database**:
- Direct SQL is permitted only with `$wpdb->prepare()`
- Prefer WordPress options/meta APIs for simple key-value or per-object storage
- Custom database tables are only permitted when the data model genuinely cannot fit existing APIs,
  with documented justification in the feature plan

**Integration Resilience**:
- All calls to optional integrations (WPBoilerplate Access Control, MCP servers) MUST be wrapped in
  availability checks and MUST NOT throw fatal errors or produce broken UIs when absent
- MCP server listing MUST use the `wpboilerplate/wpb-mcp-servers-list` Composer package — direct
  `McpAdapter::instance()->get_servers()` calls are prohibited. The package handles McpAdapter timing
  (collect at `rest_api_init` priority 20, after McpAdapter's priority 15) and returns `ServerData[]`
  objects that implement `JsonSerializable`. Wire collect via the Loader in `Main::define_admin_hooks()`:
  ```php
  $mcp_servers_list = \WPBoilerplate\McpServersList\McpServersList::instance();
  $this->loader->add_action( 'rest_api_init', $mcp_servers_list, 'collect', 20 );
  ```

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices for the AcrossAI Abilities Manager plugin.
In any conflict between this constitution and another document, this constitution takes precedence.
`AGENTS.md` remains the source of truth for tooling standards; this constitution governs architecture
and quality principles.

**Amendment Procedure**:
1. Propose the amendment in writing with clear rationale
2. Increment version following semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: backward-incompatible removal or redefinition of a principle
   - MINOR: new principle added or existing principle materially expanded
   - PATCH: clarifications, wording fixes, or non-semantic refinements
3. Update this file and propagate changes to all affected templates
4. Record a sync impact report (in the HTML comment block at the top of this file)
5. Commit with message: `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (<summary>)`

**Compliance**: All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with every principle in this
constitution. Any implementation that appears to violate a principle MUST either be refactored or
include documented justification in the feature plan explaining why a compliant approach was not
feasible.
